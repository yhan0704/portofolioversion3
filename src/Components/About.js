            Hi, My name is Young Chan Han.
            <br />I am a driven full-stack engineer with an outstanding work
            ethic open to contributing my diverse skill set in a junior-level
            position.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I hold an Associate’s Degree in Computer Science and recently
            graduated from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County with a
            Bachelor of Science Degree in Information Systems. From there I
            attended Flatiron School where I honed my skills as a developer.
            During FlatIron School’s 15-Week Intensive Software Engineering
            Program, I’ve built web applications using Redux, React, Ruby, and
            Ruby on Rails programming.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I am passionate about coding because of my drive to solve problems
            and create a final product. Beyond my academic qualifications, I
            continue to advance my skills as a developer by enhancing projects
            within my portfolio and preparing for the AWS practitioner
            certification. I welcome you to take a look at my portfolio and
            please contact me with any questions you may have.
          </p>
